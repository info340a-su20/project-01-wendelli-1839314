            <li>What is one’s risk of infection of COVID-19?</li>
            <li>Many people have little to no idea of their risk of infections from the virus.</li>
            <li>There are some graphs and articles from medical professionals that attempted to help people understand their 
                risk of infections of the coronavirus.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            My web application is designed for everyone who are concerned about their risk of infections of COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will be able to understand their risk of infections of the coronavirus. I plan to use data such as this one from 
            <a href="https://abc7news.com/covid-19-activity-risk-chart-calculator-for-assessment/6305373/">Texas Medical Association</a> 
            and 
            <a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/about-us/news-press/news-detail?articleid=26936&publicId=395">Hartford Healthcare</a> 
            to calculate one’s risk of infections from descriptions of his/her daily activities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The site will first ask users to input their daily activities, such as shopping, exercising, dining out, etc. 
            There could be several input methods to choose from, such as selecting from a list of tags that represent one popular activity. 
            Users may also enter numbers, such as number of hours they are outside or number of people they live with, to help this web app 
            to calculate a more precise result. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Making such an app will help people better understand their risk of infection. It may also eliminate 
            unnecessary worries from people who are taking comprehensive precautions. It may also raise alarms 
            for those who do not take protective actions at all when being in public spaces. 
            In general, this app can facilitate people to understand the virus in a better way.
