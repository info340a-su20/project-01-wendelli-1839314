                    COVID-19 is detrimental to everyoneâ€™s health, but its severity is often overlooked by a large number of people in the United States. Our web application is primarily designed to let you calculate your own risk of getting COVID-19. We include a list of daily activities, such as shopping, exercising, or dining out, in "Activity Center". To start off, please click the activities you've completed in a day to add to the "My Activities" box. You will then be asked to input some details related to each of the selected activities to help us generate a more precise result. We base our formula on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.texmed.org/TexasMedicineDetail.aspx?id=53977">Texas Medical Association</a> to calculate your risk of infections.
